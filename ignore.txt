Download and save ajax-store.html.
Create a data directory and download inventory.json to that folder.
Your online tool store should load data from the JSON file using a get request and append the data to the table. You will need to use either $.ajax() or $.get(), and a .done() callback.
Add some new entries to inventory.json and see how the data on the page gets updated.
Add a "Refresh" button that will load inventory.json for you without having to refresh the entire page.
Add Twitter Bootstrap to your online store with some custom CSS to make the style your own.
